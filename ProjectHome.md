This project concentrates on making it easier to find and add new skate spots.

The web application was built on the Google App Engine framework using Python, Django and the Google Maps API.

  * Easily browse the map to find spots.
  * Check in and see what your friends have been posting.
  * Browse skate spot photos and comments.

Future goals:
  * Facebook integration
  * Favorite spots
  * Better friend integration
  * Actual spot searching
  * Spot ratings
  * Feedback submission
